04-22-2021:
    - PJW fixed issue where colors wouldn't print for monster's and item's when the player was inline with them. Not sure why the code caused an issue since it was checking if the x and y of the monster or item equalled the x and y of the player not if either one of them matched.
    - PJW added to do_combat to handle the Virtual Semester infecting the player, making the map green and taking damage from the player each time. This can also happen with a 50% chance when the user kills this monster. A message shows for 7 seconds letting the player know what happend when they get infected.
    - PJW added is_infected, infect_amount, immune, immune_count, and turns_immune to the Player class to accomodate for the Holiday Break Vaccine, and the Motivation Potion.
    - PJW implemented the functionality of the vaccine and the potion in turn_decider when a user wears an object. The user also has to verify they want to use these objects in case they use it on accident.

04-21-2021:
    - PJW added INFECT ability for monsters
    - PJW added to get_next_pos() and move_character() to handle the Virtual Semester which also implemented the PASS ability (but only for this monster)

04-15-2021:
    - PJW wrote update_speed() to update the player's speed whenever they take off or wear an item
    - PJW wrote do_combat which handles when a player attacks a monster and vice versa
    - PJW wrote get_damage() which gets the total damage by rolling the player's dice for equipment slots and adding those values up. Only rolls the monster's damage dice
    - PJW wrote roll() which rolls the dice correctly
    - PJW added control for expunging an item where the carrying inventory is displayed, takes the user's input, check's if the equipment slot is valid and not empty. The user is then prompted asking if they are sure they want to expunge this item and if so, the item is deleted from the game. Otherwise, returns to the game.
    - PJW added control for looking at a monster where they can move a cursor, select a monster, and its description is displayed.
    - PJW added functionality where monsters can't kill each other, they only swap positions.
    - Controls:
        - w is to wear an item
        - t is to take off an item
        - d is to drop an item
        - x is to expunge an item
        - i is to list the PC carrying inventory
        - e is to list the PC equipped inventory
        - I is to inspect an item
        - L is to select a monster
            - Press t to select monster you want to learn about
    - Unsolvable bugs:
        - Monsters and items that are inline with the PC at any point on the map (straight left, right, up, or down), only display white and not their color
        - Sometimes LIGHT items will be picked up and placed in inventory, but you can still see the item on the map and pick it up and then weird symbols appear in the inventory list

04-14-2021:
    - PJW wrote get_equip_index() to get the index of the equipped inventory when the user enters a letter for which slot they are choosing
    - PJW added control for wearing an item where the carrying inventory is displayed, takes the user's input and checks if the equipment slot is valid and empty. The user will wear the selected item anyway but if there is already an item of that type there already, it will swap the two items
    - PJW added control for taking off an item where the equipped inventory is displayed, takes the user's input, check's if the equipment slot is valid and not empty. If there is an open carry slot, the user will take off the item. Otherwise, nothing happens
    - PJW added control for dropping an item where the carrying inventory is displayed, takes the user's input, check's if the equipment slot is valid and not empty. The item will then be dropped onto a neighboring open cell (does not have a monster, stair, or item in its space)
    - PJW added control for inspecting an item where the carrying inventory is displayed, takes the user's input, check's if the equipment slot is valid and not empty. The menu will then disappear and the item's description is displayed.
