This program successfully prints the dungeon for the game. There are at least
six rooms with a max of 15 rooms for readability. There are between 1-5 up
and down staircases each which can appear in rooms and corridors. The corridors are
connected to eachother by using a modified depth first search algorithm that I
wrote to find the shortest path to the room you are trying to connect to. dungeon.c
has all of the source code while headers.h includes all of the prototypes for the
functions. The dungeon has 6-15 randomly placed rooms that measure 4-15x3-15 units. 
There is a border around the dungeon which is just immutable rock but is added for
readability.
